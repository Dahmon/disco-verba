# Disco Verba

Disco Verba is a word training tool written in Rust.
This project is mainly a tool for me to experiment with Rust and HTMX, but is
also a tool I've wanted to build for a while.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Bunk importing of words
- [ ] AI answer analysis

## TODO

- [x] Extract routes into own modules
- [ ] Write tests
